With direct invocation the content of the event (the response from the next
invocation endpoint) contains a string which --- when interpreted as JSON ---
gives the arguments for the handler function. When a Lambda is invoked via an
API Gateway then the content of the event contains significantly more detail
and requires careful parsing. An example is given at the bottom of this
section but the two most important sections are `body` and
`queryStringParameters`

The `queryStringParameters` contain standard JSON. So if the request contains
a parameter `?number=9` in the query then the event will contain
`"queryStringParameters": {"number": "9"}` (note the string).

The `body` of the event contains the data passed during a `POST` operation.
It contains _stringified_ JSON. That is, instead of `"body": {"number": 9}`
we would see `"body": "{\"number\":9}"`.

Stringified JSON can be produced with the `as_stringified_json` helper
function which wraps `jsonlite`'s \code{\link[jsonlite]{toJSON}} function.
There is a slight difference in behaviour, as this function also
automatically unboxes singleton values and also represents `NULL`s as JSON
`nulls` --- a convention that is used by the event body provided by AWS
Lambda.

When the result is calculated and ready to be sent back to the AWS Lambda
response endpoint it must be formatted in a very specific way in order to be
compatible with the API Gateway. The correct format is as below, with the
`body` containing the _stringified_ JSON representation of the result. This
is given as an R list which is then converted to stringified JSON. Compare
this to the representation of the result for a direct invocation:

```r
## Formatting a result for a direct invocation
as_stringified_json(result)

## Formatting a result for an invocation via an API Gateway
as_stringified_json(
  list(
    isBase64Encoded = FALSE,
    statusCode = 200L,
    body = as_stringified_json(result)
  )
)
```

Here is an example event content from an invocation that is coming via an
API Gateway. The invocation is a call to a `parity` function with an argument
`number = 9`. Some information has been censored.
