    This combines the three individual setup steps: `setup_logging`,
    `lambda_config`, and `start_listening`. For most applications this is the
    only necessary function.

    Specific scenarios may require breaking the runtime setup into individual
    steps. For example, perhaps certain checks need to be run during
    initialisation. These functions --- in the order of `setup_logging`,
    `lambda_config`, and `start_listening` --- have the same outcome as
    `start_lambda`.
