    This combines the three individual setup steps: `setup_logging`,
    `lambda_config`, and `start_listening`. For most applications this is the
    only necessary function.

    The `start_lambda` function accepts a configuration object provided by
    `lambda_config`. If the Lambda environment is configured correctly
    (eg. the handler function is set through the Lambda console) then this will
    often be unnecessary. Bespoke solutions may require additional configuration
    options such as Base64 decoding, custom serialisation, etc.
